use prd skill to create a PRD to implement  OpenAPI-based Swagger documentation and client SDKs for Python and JS/TS using spec.yaml

Clarification needed: I need to ask a few clarifying questions to ensure the PRD meets your exact needs. Please answer using the lettered options:

1. What is the primary goal of implementing this documentation and SDK feature?
   A. Increase developer adoption and ease of integration for external partners.
   B. Improve internal engineering efficiency by providing automated client libraries.
   C. Ensure compliance and consistency across API versions.
   D. Other: [please specify]

2. Where should the generated Swagger documentation (UI) be hosted?
   A. Integrated directly into the existing application's UI route (e.g., /docs).
   B. Hosted as a standalone, static site (e.g., on S3/Netlify).
   C. Generated but not hosted yet (deliver the static files).
   D. Hidden behind an authentication wall.

3. What is the desired level of automation for SDK generation?
   A. Manual generation only (Developer runs a script when spec.yaml changes).
   B. Automated generation in CI/CD (SDKs are rebuilt and published on every spec change).
   C. Use a public service (e.g., OpenAPI Generator Online) for initial setup.
   D. Only generate the Python SDK first; JS/TS is a fast-follow.

4. What is the scope for the Python and JS/TS SDKs?
   A. Minimal viable client: Focus on authentication and basic CRUD operations only.
   B. Full feature parity: Include all operations defined in spec.yaml, robust error handling, and type safety.
   C. Just the core API calls; exclude any utility functions or extensive documentation within the SDK itself.
   D. Python SDK must be pip-installable; JS/TS must be NPM-publishable.
