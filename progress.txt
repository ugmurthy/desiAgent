## Codebase Patterns
- The `result` column in `dags` table is `TEXT` with `mode: 'json'` - store objects directly (not JSON.stringify'd strings)
- Use `as any` for result/usage in insert data to satisfy drizzle types
- TitleMaster async generation pattern: `generateTitleAsync(activeLLMProvider, goalText)` returns title with usage stats

- Implemented persistence for clarification-needed DAGs with status 'pending'
- Files changed:
  - src/core/execution/dags.ts: Updated ClarificationRequiredResult type, added DB persistence block
  - src/types/client.ts: Updated ClarificationRequiredResult type to include dagId
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ClarificationRequiredResult now only has { status, dagId, clarificationQuery }
  - Removed result, usage, generationStats from ClarificationRequiredResult - use dagId to fetch if needed
  - Clarification DAGs are stored with status='pending' and can be queried for debugging
