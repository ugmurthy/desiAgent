I am learning to make decorative furniture using drift wood found on river banks. Search for best practices for cleaning drift wood, any pre processing needed for preservation of wood and tools and tips for working on drift wood. list all materials such as oils, finishing coats, tools. I would also be interested in example projects that would act as a learn by doing guide. Something small would be useful. Use all information to compile a tutorial called drift-wood-begginer.md
